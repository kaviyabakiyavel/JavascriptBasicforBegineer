// <!-- seperation of concerns  -->

// <!-- Example thing of your house you have a bed room and your clothes , you dont store clothes in the kitchen .
// This is what we call seperation of concerns . You have the same principle in programming
// so we want to seperate html which is all about content , 
// And javascript is all about behaviour , how should your webpage behave
// what should happen when we hover our mouse over a given element?
// Maybe something should pop up maybe somthing should be hidden,
