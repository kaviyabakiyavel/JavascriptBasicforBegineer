// static vs Dynamic type 

//we have two types of programming languages .
//static laguages or dynamic languages 
// In static languages when we declare the variable 
//eg: string name = 'Kaviya'; 
// the type of the variable is set and it cannot be changed in the future 

//but in dynamic language like javascript the type of variable can change in run time .
let name = 'kaviya'
typeof(name) //string so type of the name is string 
name = 1 
typeof(name) //number now type is changed to number 
//so this is wat we called as dynamic language 

let age = 30 ;
age = 30.1
typeof(30.1) 
//output "number" in javascript we dont have floating point number
//all number should be number in javascript
