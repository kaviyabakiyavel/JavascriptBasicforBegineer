// In programming we use a variable to store data temporarily 
// So we store out data somewhere , and give that memory location a name 
// And with this name , we can read the data at the given location in 
// the futue . 

// Example think of a box used to organize your stuff .
// you put your stuff in various boxes , and put a label on each box .
// And with this easily find your stuff . 
// A vaiable i like a box , what we put inside the box , 
// is the value that we assign to a variable , 
// and the label that we put on the box is the name of our variable . 


//ES5 VARIABLE DECLARATION 

//ES6 best paratice to declare the variable by using let keyword

let name ;
console.log(name); // Undefined 

let name = 'kaviya';
console.log(name);

//rules for naming variables 
// 1) Cannot be a reserved keyword like (let if , else,soon)
// 2) Should be meaningful (wrong let x no meaning )
// 3) Cannot start with a number (wrong 1name)
// 4) Cannot contain a space or hyphen(-) 
// 5) Are case-sensitive (correct eg camelnotation : firstName)
// 6) Modern best practise decelare variable in single line 
// eg : let firstName = 'Kaviya'
//      let lastName = 'Bakiyavel'
